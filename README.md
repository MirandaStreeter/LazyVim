I got tired of curating my neovim experience from scratch.
Time to defer to community presets and work my way from there.

### Resetting state and using this config:
```
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak} \
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak} \
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak} \
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak} \
git clone https://github.com/MirandaStreeter/LazyVim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
